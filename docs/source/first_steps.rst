First Steps
===========

Hello World :) 
-----------

First, collecting data of galeries, shafts and coal seams  as a geopackage.

*Insert here a minimal example of how to start using GSDMA_2021.*

A few steps further
-------------------

GSDMA_2021 is used to model the geometry of a coal mine in order to modelise several things with modeflow. It used basic functions such as drawing shafts, galeries and coal seams on basis of real data. The limits of the geometries are defined at first. Then the geometries are grided so that it is possible to assign different properties to each grid. The main function are exposed in `the part function.


*Insert here information about how to use GSDMA_2021 in a limited but real use case. Expose the basic or most frequently used functionalities.*
